# project-3-create-a-web-server-on-ec2

# Week 3 Project

In this project, I launched an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2023 and configured it as a web server with Apache (httpd). I created a customized webpage with a visually appealing design. The setup is automated using my data, ensuring that the web server and webpage are configured automatically upon instance startup.
